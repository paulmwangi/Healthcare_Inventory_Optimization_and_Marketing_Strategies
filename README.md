### Business Problem
The marketing team at a healthcare platform needs actionable insights from inventory data to refine their promotional strategies. By understanding inventory dynamics, they can better target their promotions, ensuring that items in stock are highlighted and those running low are restocked promptly.

### Business Objective
To leverage inventory data analysis to enhance the effectiveness of marketing strategies, ensuring optimal stock levels and targeted promotions that drive sales and improve customer satisfaction.

### Overview
In this scenario, I was provided with a dataset containing detailed information about the inventory on a healthcare platform. My task was to analyze this dataset and extract insights that would help the marketing team improve their promotional strategies. The analysis focused on the following key points:

- **Average Price Analysis**:
  - Calculate the average price of items with physical inventory.
  - Calculate the average price of items without physical inventory.

- **Storeroom Inventory Analysis**:
  - Identify which storeroom has the most inventory.

- **Price Modification Timing**:
  - Determine the time in minutes since item prices were last modified.

- **Stock Status**:
  - List items that are running out of stock.
  - List items whose quantity is zero and how long (in minutes) they have been in this state.

By addressing these points, the marketing team can gain valuable insights into inventory trends and make informed decisions to optimize their promotional strategies. This will help ensure that high-demand items are adequately stocked and promoted, while also identifying opportunities to clear out items that are not moving.
